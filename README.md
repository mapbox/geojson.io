# geojson.io

![](http://i.cloudup.com/kz3BAF7Hnx.png)

A fast, simple editor for map data. Read more on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/geojsonio-announce/),

## Goes Great With!

**Tools**

- [Using geojson.io with GitHub is better with the Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geojsonio/oibjgofbhldcajfamjganpeacipebckp)
- [geojsonio-cli](https://github.com/mapbox/geojsonio-cli) lets you shoot geojson from your terminal to geojson.io! (with nodejs)
- [geojsonio.py](https://github.com/jwass/geojsonio.py) lets you shoot geojson from your terminal to geojson.io! (with python)

## API

You can interact with geojson.io programmatically via URL parameters. Here is an example of geojson encoded into the URL:

http://geojson.io/#data=data:application/json,%7B%22type%22%3A%22LineString%22%2C%22coordinates%22%3A%5B%5B0%2C0%5D%2C%5B10%2C10%5D%5D%7D

Full API documentation can be found in [API.md](API.md).

## Development

Install [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)'ied libraries:

`npm install`

Browserify libraries, concat other libraries, build minimal d3, build tailwind css:

`make`

Run a local server to preview your changes.

### Development with VSCode extensions (hot reloading)

An optimized development workflow is possible with the `Live Server` and `Run on Save` VS Code extensions.  Both have workspace-specific settings in `settings.json`:

- Start a live server using `Live Server's` "Go Live" button
- `Run on Save` will watch `/lib`,`/src`, and `css/tailwind_src.css` and run `make` when any of them change.
- `Live Server` will ignore `/lib`,`/src`, and `css/tailwind_src.css`, but will hot reload whenever any other file changes (including the files created by `make`)

### Tests    

The foundations of an end-to-end test suite are in place using playwright, but need additional coverage.  Contributions from the community are welcomed to help increase our test coverage.

`npm run test-e2e`

To run the tests non-headless and see what's happening in the browser:

`npx playwright test --headed`
