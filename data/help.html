<h2>Help</h2>

<p><strong>geojson.io</strong> is a quick, simple tool for creating,
    viewing, and sharing spatial data. geojson.io is named after <a href='http://geojson.org/' target='_blank'>GeoJSON</a>,
    an open source spatial data format, and it supports GeoJSON in all ways - but also
    accepts KML, GPX, CSV, GTFS, TopoJSON, and other formats.</p>

<p>Want to request a feature or report a bug? <a target='_blank'
        href='https://github.com/mapbox/geojson.io/issues?state=open'>Open
        an issue
        on geojson.io's issue tracker.</a>

<h3>I've got data</h3>

<p>If you have data, like a KML, GeoJSON, or CSV file, just drag &amp; drop
    it onto the page or click 'Open' and select your file. Your data should appear on
    the map!</p>

<p>You may also paste geojson data into the code editor.</p>

<p>To ensure consistent rendering and interoperability with other spatial data formats, the working dataset in geojson.io is always a geojson FeatureCollection. If you import a standalone Feature or Geometry, it will be normalized into a FeatureCollection.</p>

<h3>I want to draw features</h3>

<p>Use the drawing tools to draw points, polygons,
    lines, rectangles, and circles. After you're done drawing the shapes, you can add
    information to each feature by clicking on it, editing the feature's properties,
    and clicking 'Save'.</p>

<p>Note: Circles are not supported in GeoJSON, so the circle drawing tool is really creating a circle-shaped polygon
    with 64 vertices.</p>

<h3>I want to edit features</h3>

<p>To edit geometries, click the edit button to enter editng mode. All Features are selected by default. Click to select a Feature or Vertex. Press delete to remove selected Feature or Vertex. Drag to move selected vertex. Shift + drag to move selected Feature(s)</p>

<p>Properties in GeoJSON are stored as 'key value pairs'. You can edit properties in three ways: 1 - Click the feature on the map and edit properties in the popup. 2 - Edit properties in the data table, 3 - Edit properties in the Code editor</p>


<h3>I'm a coder</h3>

<p><a href='#geojson-io-api'>geojson.io accepts URL parameters</a>
    that make it easy to go from a GeoJSON file on your computer to geojson.io.

<h3>Privacy &amp; License Issues</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The data you create and modify in geojson.io</strong> doesn't
        acquire any additional license: if it's secret and copyrighted, it will remain
        that way - it doesn't have to be public or open source.
    </li>
