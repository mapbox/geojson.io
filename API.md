## Geojson.io API
You can interact with geojson.net programmatically in two ways:

* [URL parameters](#url-api)
* [Browser console](#console-api)
* [Protips](#protips)

## URL API
You can do a few interesting things with just URLs and geojson.net. Here are the
current URL formats.

### `map`

Open the map at a specific location. The argument is numbers separated by `/`
in the form `zoom/latitude/longitude`.

#### Example:

http://geojson.net/#map=2/20.0/0.0


### `data=data:application/json,`

Open the map and load a chunk of [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) data from a
URL segment directly onto the map. The GeoJSON data should be encoded
as per `encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(geojson_data))`.

#### Example:

http://geojson.net/#data=data:application/json,%7B%22type%22%3A%22LineString%22%2C%22coordinates%22%3A%5B%5B0%2C0%5D%2C%5B10%2C10%5D%5D%7D


### `data=data:text/x-url,`

Load GeoJSON data from a URL on the internet onto the map. The URL must
refer directly to a resource that is:

* Freely accessible (not behind a password)
* Supports [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
* Is valid GeoJSON

The URL should be encoded as per `encodeURIComponent(url)`.

#### Example:

http://geojson.net/#data=data:text/x-url,http%3A%2F%2Fapi.tiles.mapbox.com%2Fv3%2Ftmcw.map-gdv4cswo%2Fmarkers.geojson


### `id=gist:`

Load GeoJSON data from a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), given an argument
in the form of `login/gistid`. The Gist can be public or private, and must
contain a file with a `.geojson` extension that is valid GeoJSON.

#### Example:

http://geojson.net/#id=gist:tmcw/e9a29ad54dbaa83dee08&map=8/39.198/-76.981


### `id=github:`

Load a file from a GitHub repository. You must have access to the file, and
it must be valid GeoJSON.

The url is in the form:

    login/repository/blob/branch/filepath

#### Example:

http://geojson.net/#id=github:benbalter/dc-wifi-social/blob/master/bars.geojson&map=14/38.9140/-77.0302

## Console API

[Pop open your browser console](http://debugbrowser.com/) and see the beautiful
examples: geojson.net has started to expose a subset of its inner workings for
you to mess around with:


### `window.api.map`

The [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map that you see and use on the site. See
the [Leaflet API](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html) for all the things you
can do with it.

For instance, you could add another map layer:

```js
window.api.map.addLayer(L.tileLayer('http://tile.stamen.com/watercolor/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg'))
```

### `window.api.data`

The data model. See the [code to get an idea of how it works](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson.net/blob/gh-pages/src/core/data.js#L48-L90) -
you'll want to use stuff like `data.set({ map: { .. your geojson map information .. })`
and `data.get('map')` and `data.mergeFeatures([arrayoffeatures])` to do your
dirty business.

## `window.api.mapLayer`

This is the Leaflet featureGroup that gets filled with features as you draw
them. You can operate on this directly to do advanced stuff like
selecting a feature with its id:

```js
var layers = [];
window.api.mapLayer.eachLayer(l => { layers.push(l); });
layers.find(l => l.feature.id == 'a').openPopup();
```

That example uses [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
which are supported in Chrome & Firefox.

## `window.api.drawControl`

Exposes the [Leaflet.Draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) control
instance in the console.

## `window.api.on(event, fn)`

Exposes d3 events, including `change`.

## Protips

To include `turf` from [turf](https://github.com/turfjs/turf) so you can manipulate features
with its GIS features, run this in the CLI, which will download the script and evaluate it.

```js
fetch('https://npmcdn.com/@turf/turf@3.1.1/turf.js').then(t => t.text()).then(eval)
```
